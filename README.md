This program is a chaos bag simulator for Arkham Horror: The Card Game. 

Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a cooperative card game based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft. The chaos bag plays an important part in the game. Before playing, players assemble tokens and place them inside a bag. Throughout the game, the players randomly draw tokens from the bag. Some tokens have a number value and some tokens have symbols.
